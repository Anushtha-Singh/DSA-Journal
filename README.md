# ðŸ’» Anushtha's DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my structured Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository!  
This is where I consistently solve problems topic-wise and implement multiple approaches â€” not just to find the answer, but to deeply understand the core logic and variations of each problem. Iâ€™m following the **Striver's Take U Forward DSA Sheet**, using it as a roadmap to master essential topics for coding.


## ðŸš€ Goals

- Practice and master 100+ core DSA problems
- Improve implementation speed and clarity
- Track all four DP approaches per problem
- Build a portfolio of clean, modular, and readable code
- Use this repo for revision before interviews or contests

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All code is written in C++17
- Focus is on clarity, structure, and learning â€” not just brute solutions
- No external libraries except standard headers
